# Assignment_10 :

A bounding box in a two-dimensional cartesian space (x,y) space is calculated 
so that it contains all the given (x,y) points. 
To Create a bounding box class with four bounding points that shall be called as NW, NE, SW, SE coordinates. 
To Write a Java program that shall take given points (x,y) from the console
and computes the bounding box based on the minimum and maximum of the xth and the yth values of given points.
To use sortinglist array for finding min and max value of given points from space.
To find remaining point to draw outboinding four points.
Draw the lines up,down,left and right as per near outing points.
